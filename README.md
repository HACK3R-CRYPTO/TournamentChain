# TournamentChain

Compete in tournaments. Win crypto prizes. Own your assets. A decentralized gaming platform built for true digital ownership.

## What You Get

You play games. You compete in tournaments. You win Gold and Diamond tokens. Your assets are NFTs. Your rank is on-chain. No centralized gatekeepers. No lost items. Pure skill-based competition.

## How It Works

Connect your wallet. Mint your starter assets. Join a tournament. Play Wave Defense. Survive longer than others. Submit your score. Claim your prize. All powered by smart contracts.

## Your First Game

Step one: Connect your wallet. Use MetaMask or Social Login. Switch to Sepolia Testnet.

Step two: Mint Free Tokens. Go to Profile. Use the Faucet. Get Gold and Diamond tokens for testing.

Step three: Mint Assets. Mint your first Weapon and Skin. These are ERC-1155 NFTs. They live in your wallet.

Step four: Join a Tournament. Browse active tournaments. Pay the entry fee in Gold.

Step five: Play Wave Defense. Defend against waves of enemies. Survive as long as you can. Your score is verified on-chain.

Step six: Claim Rewards. If you place in the top ranks, the prize pool is yours. Gold and Diamonds are sent directly to your wallet.

## Future Roadmap

We are just getting started. Wave Defense is the MVP. Here is what comes next:

- **More Mini-Games**: The infrastructure is ready. We will add Flappy Bird, Tower Defense, and Puzzle games. The "Mini Games" section is already in the codebase.
- **In-Game Shop**: A dedicated marketplace. Buy potions. Upgrade weapons. Trade skins directly with other players.
- **Advanced Anti-Cheat**: Moving beyond signature verification. We plan to implement Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to validate game logic on-chain without revealing secrets.
- **Expanded Leaderboards**: Weekly leagues. Clan wars. Seasonal rankings with massive prize pools.

## Built for Hackathon

TournamentChain built for the Gaming & Entertainment Track. Solves asset ownership. Solves payout trust. Solves interoperability. Ready for players.
